"""Simple smart order router (SOR).

This module exposes a :func:`route_order` helper that inspects quotes
across multiple venues and submits the order through the venue offering
best execution.  It expects each venue to be represented by an
``ExecutionClient`` that optionally implements a ``quote`` method
returning ``(price, volume)`` for a given symbol.

If only a single execution client is provided, the function falls back to
sending the order directly without routing.
